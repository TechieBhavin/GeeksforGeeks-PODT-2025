</a></h2>  <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr>

<p>Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.</p>
<b>Note:</b> <p>In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.</p>

<b>Examples:</b>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]
<b>Output:</b> 6
<b>Explanation:</b> 5 and 3 are 2 distance apart. So the size of the base is 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 3 * 2 = 6.
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
<b>Output:</b> 12
<b>Explanation:</b> 5 and 3 are 4 distance apart. So the size of the base is 4. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 4 * 3 = 12.
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> arr[] = [2, 1, 8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5]
<b>Output:</b> 25
<b>Explanation:</b> 8 and 5 are 5 distance apart. So the size of the base is 5. Height of container = min(8, 5) = 5. So, the total area to hold water = 5 * 5 = 25.
